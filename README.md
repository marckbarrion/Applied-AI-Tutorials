## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains the complete source codes and notebooks featured in the [Applied AI Tutorials](https://appliedaitutorials.com) website â€” a learning series that bridges **theory and practice** in Artificial Intelligence.

Each tutorial follows a consistent structure:
1. **Sneak Peek / Why it Matters** â€“ Real-world motivation for the AI concept.  
2. **Theory Deep Dive** â€“ Core ideas, equations, and intuition.  
3. **Toy Problem** â€“ Step-by-step code walkthrough.  
4. **Real-World Application** â€“ Practical use-case implementation.  
5. **Quick References** â€“ Compact, copy-ready scripts.
